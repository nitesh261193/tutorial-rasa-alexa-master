## What's in this repository?

This repository consists of the following files and directories:  
- **mood_bot_text** - a directory which contains a pre-built Rasa assistant called Moodbot Text, based on the [Moodbot](https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa/tree/master/examples/moodbot) example that's built when you run `init rasa`. This assistant is used to demonstrate the integration to Alexa.
- **alexa_schema.json** - a custom Alexa configuration file that will create an intent and slot to return the user's complete response.
